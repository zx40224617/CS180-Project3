      <h2 class="title">Background of the project:</h2>
      <p class="introduction">
        In this project, we are asked to morph a face to another face, and 
        create an animation (gif) for that. We also need to compute the "mean"
        face of a population, and extrapolate from the "mean" face to create
        a caricature of myself. 
      </p>

      <h3>Part 1. Defining Correspondences</h3>
      <p class="description">
        In order for the morphing to work, we need consistent labeling point on both 
        faces. Which we need to define the correspondence manually on face, 
        ear, nose, etc... <br/><br>
        In this case, I used <a href ="https://cal-cs180.github.io/fa23/hw/proj3/tool.html">this</a> labeling tool that is 
        provided in the assignment specs for labeling the correspondence. 
      </p>

      </div>
      <p class="description">
        After we get the lableing point, we can plug it into the Delaunay 
        method that will create the triangulation that we need for morphing.
        Note that the green dots you see below is the labeling that we chose
        using the tool.

      <h3 class="title">Part 2. Computing the "Mid-way Face":</h3>
      <p class="description">
        Before we get into the morphing sequence for animation, we need to first
        get the "mid-way" face. Here is the process: 
        
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>computing the average shape of the 2 faces</li>
        <li>warping both faces into that average shape</li> 
        <li>averaging the colors together (Cross-Dissolving)</li>
    </ol>
 
      <p class="description">
        For computing in the average shape, we just need to add all the labeling points in 2
        faces together and divided by 2 (or times 0.5 to each of them, which will 
        make more sense in the next part when we do sequence). Same thing with the 
        average color, just times 0.5 to each of the faces and add them together. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The main issue here is the warping, what we are doing here is that, 
        we need to compute the Affine transformation for all the triangles
        in the triangulation to the avaerage shape. 
        And for the pixels, we need to extrapolate the original pixels into the 
        pixels that we need in the mean face. In this case, in order to get a better 
        results and prevent holes, we will use inverse-warping.

      <h3 class="title">Part 3. The Morph Sequence    </h3>
      <p class="description">
        After we get the mean face, what we need to do now is implement the 
        idea and make a gif or video using the "morphing sequence". Which we 
        want to make an animation that a face gradually changing to another face. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The morphing sequence is bascially just a bunch of morphing faces
        stacked together. Same logic as the mean face, but this time, instead
        of the fixed 0.5 that we times each image, we have one of the image started as 1, and the other
        started at 0. Depends on how many morphing faces you want for creating the
        animation, you have an alpha = 1 / num_of_face. And you basically use a for loop
        to compute the shape and the color for each step using a formula like the
        following:
        <br>
        average_shape = img1Points * (1 - t)  + img2Points * t (same logic for the color)

      <h3 class="title">Part 4. The "Mean face" of a population:</h3>
      <p class="description">
      In this part, we need to compute the mean face for a population of 
      people. And warp our own face into its geimetry and also wrap the 
      mean face into mt face geometry. Over here, I use the first 100
      faces in the FEI database. Note that there are some picture that 
      have labeling points outside of the image where I just get rid of them 
      as the outliers.

      <h3 class="title">Part 5. Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean:</h3>
      <p class="description">
        In this part, we are asked to create a caricature of our own face from the 
        population mean face that we computed in the last part. Since we are suggested 
        that this may work better with some characteristics specific mean, so I decided
        to used the mean smiling face that we got in the last part.  
    </p>
    <p class="imgTitle">My face extrapolated into the smile face with alpha = 2:</p>

        As you can see, my face is now smiling, although it is not that
        obvious because my mouth is not opened.

        In this bells and whistle, I tried to use the average Chinese women
        face that I found <a href ="https://pmsol3.wordpress.com/2009/10/10/world-of-facial-averages-east-southeast-asia-pacific-islander/">online</a> to change the gender of my face. We are also
        asked to show the example where we only morph the shape or appearance.

 Sorry for hurting your eyes, I apologize to who ever is reading this. But I think it
 is quite successful that my face now look more like a woman than a man.
